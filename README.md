<h1><strong>Create Openbook Market ID Only 0.2 SOL - How to Get Raydium Market ID?</strong></h1>

<p><strong>What is Raydium Market ID?</strong><br>
The most preferred DeFi platform on the Solana network is Raydium.io, and if you want to get your token project listed and traded there, you need to create an ID called "Openbook Market ID". OpenBook is a decentralized and open-source implementation of the Serum V3 protocol available on Solana.<br>
You need to have an Openbook Market ID to be listed on DeFi platforms like Raydium.io.</p>

<h1>Create a Cheap Openbook Market ID</h1>

<p>The price you have to pay to get a Raydium.io Market ID is around "3 SOL" nowadays. However, with the method I'm going to tell you, you can get a market id that is 100% compatible with Raydium.io for only 0.2 SOL.<br>
Through Openbooklab.xyz, one of the first sites to support Openbookv2, you can create a market id that is fully compatible with Serum V3 liquidity. The "Length" values are very high and the cost is only around 0.2 SOL. If you are curious how this new system works, you can see the open source code on the Github link at the end of this article. You can access the Openbooklab.xyz website from the link below.</p>

<p><em>Note: Do not try to reduce the fee by changing the "Length" values in Advanced Options on sites like Dexlab! This is the wrong approach and will lead to problems in the Serum V3 liquidity center. One of these problems is that users will receive frequent errors when trading. This will negatively affect the credibility of your project.</em><br>
Before you start your configuration, you can understand how easy the process is from the video below. If your project needs a special pricing requirement, you can configure your settings as you wish according to the detailed examples in the description below.</p>
